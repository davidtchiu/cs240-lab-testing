 * A valid email is formatted user@domain, where user is:
 * - First initial appended to last name
 * - A maximum 8 characters long, so you may have to truncate the last name
 * - Cannot be duplicated in the system. Look in the 'existing' array for duplicates.
 *   If a duplicate is detected, you must replace the last character(s) of the user
 *   name with the next available integer value, starting with 2.
 *
 * For instance, if brichard already exists, then the next instance should be brichar2.
 * And if brichar2, brichar3, ..., brichar9, exist, then the next instance should be
 * bricha10.

 * @param {string} first    First name
